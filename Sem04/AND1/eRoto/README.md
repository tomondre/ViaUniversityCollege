AND Hand-in 2 - eRoto

The app that I will be creating will be a trading platform. Because stocks/funds investing is very interesting to me and I have been educating myself in these areas for a while, I think it can be an enggaging project to me.<br/>
I am using a general repository that I have created for my Via studies, therefore the project itself can be found here: Sem04/AND1/eRoto (Sorry for this inconvenience). <br/>
The name eRoto is just a 'parody name' to the original company eToro. (I know the name suggest other things but that is not a goal.).
eRoto file itself is a project, therefore this file needs to be opened in order to run the android app.
